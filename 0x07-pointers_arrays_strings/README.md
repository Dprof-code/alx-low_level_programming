# 0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

This directory contains my solutions to programming problems using the C programming language, specifically focusing on Pointers, arrays and strings. As a beginner in C programming, I will be completing various tasks and projects to solidify my understanding of the language and gain experience with its syntax.

Within this directory, each file corresponds to a different task, with a detailed explanation of the problem and the approach I took to solve it. Some of the tasks covered in this directory include printing text to the console, working with variables, and writing simple functions.

I hope to continue building on my knowledge of C programming through this directory, with the ultimate goal of becoming proficient in the language and applying it to real-world projects. Please feel free to browse through the directory, use the code in your own projects, and leave any comments or feedback.
