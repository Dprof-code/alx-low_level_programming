# 0x0A. C - argc, argv

This directory contains my solutions to programming problems using the C programming language, specifically focusing on ARGC and ARGV. As a beginner in C programming, I will be completing various tasks and projects to solidify my understanding of the language and gain experience with its syntax.

Within this directory, each file corresponds to a different task, with a detailed explanation of the problem and the approach I took to solve it. Some of the tasks covered in this directory include printing text to the console, working with variables, and writing simple functions.

I hope to continue building on my knowledge of C programming through this directory, with the ultimate goal of becoming proficient in the language and applying it to real-world projects. Please feel free to browse through the directory, use the code in your own projects, and leave any comments or feedback.

## Learning Objectives

- How to use arguments passed to your program
- What are two prototypes of ```main``` that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
- How to use ```__attribute__((unused))``` or ```(void)``` to compile functions with unused variables or parameters
