# 0x14. C - Bit manipulation

This directory contains my solutions to programming problems using the C programming language, specifically focusing on Bit Manipulation.

Bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data shorter than a byte. C language is very efficient in manipulating bits.

### Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit by bit operation.

| &   | AND         |
| --- | ----------- |
| \|  | OR          |
| ~   | NOT         |
| <<  | Left Shift  |
| >>  | Right Shift |

| A   | B   | A\|B | A&B | A^B | ~A  |
| --- | --- | ---- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0    | 0   | 0   | 1   |
| 0   | 1   | 1    | 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   | 1    | 0   | 1   | 0   |
| 1   | 1   | 1    | 1   | 0   | 0   |

Within this directory, each file corresponds to a different task, with a detailed explanation of the problem and the approach I took to solve it. Some of the tasks covered in this directory include printing text to the console, working with variables, and writing simple functions.

I hope to continue building on my knowledge of C programming through this directory, with the ultimate goal of becoming proficient in the language and applying it to real-world projects. Please feel free to browse through the directory, use the code in your own projects, and leave any comments or feedback.
