# 0x03. C - Debugging

This directory contains my solutions to programming problems using the C programming language, specifically focusing on Debugging.Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly. As you become a more advanced programmer and an industry engineer, you will learn how to use debugging tools such as gdb or built-in tools that IDEs have. However, itâ€™s important to understand the concepts and processes of debugging manually. As a beginner in C programming, I will be completing various tasks and projects to solidify my understanding of the language and gain experience with its syntax.

Within this directory, each file corresponds to a different task, with a detailed explanation of the problem and the approach I took to solve it. Some of the tasks covered in this directory include printing text to the console, working with variables, and writing simple functions.

I hope to continue building on my knowledge of C programming through this directory, with the ultimate goal of becoming proficient in the language and applying it to real-world projects. Please feel free to browse through the directory, use the code in your own projects, and leave any comments or feedback.
