# 0x09. C - Static libraries

This directory contains my solutions to programming problems using the C programming language, specifically focusing on Static Libraries. As a beginner in C programming, I will be completing various tasks and projects to solidify my understanding of the language and gain experience with its syntax.

In the C programming language, a static library is a compiled object file containing all symbols required by the main program to operate (functions, variables etc.) as opposed to having to pull in separate entities. Static libraries aren't loaded by the compiler at run-time; only the executable file need be loaded.Static libraries are just collections of object files that are linked into the program during the linking phase of compilation, and are not relevant during runtime.

Within this directory, each file corresponds to a different task, with a detailed explanation of the problem and the approach I took to solve it. Some of the tasks covered in this directory include printing text to the console, working with variables, and writing simple functions.

I hope to continue building on my knowledge of C programming through this directory, with the ultimate goal of becoming proficient in the language and applying it to real-world projects. Please feel free to browse through the directory, use the code in your own projects, and leave any comments or feedback.

## Learning Objectives

- What is a static library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it
- Basic usage of ```ar```, ```ranlib```, ```nm```
